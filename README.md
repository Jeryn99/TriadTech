This mod serves as an addon for the [TARDIS Refined](https://modrinth.com/mod/tardis-refined) mod!

It adds the following new upgrades to the TARDIS:

- Emergency Exit: Rightclick your TARDIS key to summon the TARDIS to you directly. This however consumes the key.
- Blue Stabilizers: With this upgrade, flight dances will no longer happen when you travel with the throttle at its lowest stage.
